                    <h2>Why Poetry?</h2>
                    <span></span>
                    <p>What even is poetry...? Well.... I believe poetry is a creation of words strung together to express some kind of emotion, a feeling, whether it is about beauty or tragedy. Actually, they may be quite the same thing. Beauty is tragedy and tragedy is beauty. And that is what poetry is to me. A story of something moving, something that urges you to leave your comfort zone and feel things you have never quite experienced before. Poetry forces you to stimulate your heart and mind. The meaning of every word may not come out as bluntly as a book would tell you. The “less is more” approach is a much more compelling way to tell a story. I have been a fan of poetry my entire life, possibly since I could learn to read. I was always so curious about its many forms and its many interpretations. I share whatever words flow through me in hopes that readers can resonate with some of my joys, my pains, my struggles, and my journey. Poetry allows me to be my most vulnerable self… freely. Poetry is one of my favorite, if not my actual favorite, types of art. It is a true blessing to be able to read different types of poetry out there, at least to me. “You see what you need to see” is something I tell myself whenever I read poetry. Every poem means something different to each and every person that encounters it. I absolutely adore the variety, the expanding of the mind and heart that comes with this. Poetry is something I believe every human being should dip their toe in every now and then, if not a regular hobby. It is something that allows a human being to go beyond the surface, into the soul, and find out about oneself and the world much more than we thought we could ever know. I hope you enjoy MY words. Thank you for stopping by.</p>
